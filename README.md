# Bamazon

![Customer](/mdImages/Screenshot5.png)

Bamazon is a app that creates an on-line store.  It allows customers to select items for purchase. 

![Manager](/mdImages/Screenshot6.png) 

It allows managers to inventory products using a department store model, inventory quantities that are available, and add new products.  To make this process easier, the app is able to show all products or only the products with low inventory.  

![Supervisor](/mdImages/Screenshot7.png)

It also allows supervisors to view all products by departments and gives them the ability to create new departments.  This project makes it easier to handle a storefront by keeping up with your inventory.  

## How to install
To install this project, first clone it from the GiHub, then run `npm install`.  This will install all the needed node packages for the app to run.  Then run the JavaScript file by positions (customer, manager, and/or supervisor) needed.  

Eric Sanders is the full stack developer of this project.
